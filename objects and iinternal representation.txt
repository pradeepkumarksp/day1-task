Question - Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

1.what is object?
	 *.It’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
	 *.This is quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean).
	 *.Its more complex.
	 *.Each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
	 *.Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.
	 *.objects are unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
	 *.These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods.

1.Object Properties:
 --Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object”.

    For ex:
	var myCar = new Object();

	myCar.make = 'Suzuki';

	myCar.model = 'Altros';

	myCar.year = 1978;

	myCar.wheels = 2;
   *.After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.
	i.e.

	myCar.year

	Output: 1978
i).The syntax for adding a property to an object is :
	 ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;

ii).The syntax for deleting a property from an object is:
	delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;

iii).The syntax to access a property from an object is:
	objectName.property        
           //or
	objectName["property”]     
           //or
	objectName[expression] 

2.Object methods:
	--An object method is an object property containing a function definition
		-- function(){return ignition.on}

3.Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal:

	One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values inside curly braces.
	ex. let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};

4.Create JavaScript Object with Constructor:
	*. its  allows to create multiple objects of same flavor.
	ex.
		function Vehicle(name, maker) {
	   	this.name = name;
   		this.maker = maker;
		}
		let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
		let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
			console.log(car1.name);    //Output: Fiesta
			console.log(car2.name);    //Output: Santa Fe

5.Using the Object.create method:
	*.Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. 
	*.it allows to choose the prototype object for the object to create, without having to define a constructor function.
